## ðŸ“„ `execute` Response Shape

The `execute` function returns a `Promise` with the following structure:

| Property  | Type                      | Description                                    |
|-----------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `error?`  | `Error`                   | The error object, if any occurred.             |
| `rows`    | `T`                       | The full result set from the query.            |
| `row`     | `ElementType<T> \| null`  | The first row in the result, or `null` if empty. |
| `result`  | `T`                       | Alias for `rows`.                              |
| `failed`  | `boolean`                 | `true` if the query failed.                    |
| `success` | `boolean`                 | `true` if the query succeeded.                 |

> ðŸ’¡ `ElementType<T>` is a utility type that extracts the item type from an array type `T`. For example, if `T` is `User[]`, then `ElementType<T>` will be `User`.
